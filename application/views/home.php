				<p>There is a growing need for solutions within small businesses which currently employ their own methods to deliver goods as well track both employee&#39s and their performance.  The current systems are wasteful and lack efficiency.  Its time for a change, our goal is to provide a product which will bring a new level of control and ability when it comes to managing deliveries by providing a web application that allows for optimization of delivery routes.  Providing a tool for gathering data to perform analytics on current employees&#39 and their delivery performance within a city.  This will allow for a reduction in use of resources such as paper as well manpower when it comes to handling daily deliveries in a small business.  Not only this but allow for managers to really get a grasp on how often deliveries occur within their given delivery areas.  Fleet Intelligence is designed to be lightweight and responsive with the power to produce gains in efficiency and profitability for small businesses.</p>
